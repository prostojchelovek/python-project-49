"Brain Games" is a set of five console games, built on the principle of popular mobile applications for pumping the brain. Each game asks questions to which you need to give correct answers.

* Determining a prime number

* Determining the greatest common divisor

* Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers

* Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be calculated

* Determining an even number
